# Jade.php

Jade.php adds inline PHP scripting support to the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) template compiler.

## Implementation details

The fork is a complete rewrite, all the code is ported from the original jade project.

All the features from the original are supported but undertested, including inheritance
and mixins.
